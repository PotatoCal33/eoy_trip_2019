        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out her window for about an hour now. On her desk, 
            lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist</i>, and all the other
            scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road.
            </cite> It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these
            four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde
            quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q>
            Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the llama 
            <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement. Molly <em>
            did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
